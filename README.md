# fastSDR
A faster way to calculate SDR than museval.metrics.bss_eval
museval.metrics.bss_eval takes a very long time to compute, this is especially prominent when only going for the SDR values, without the other metrics in mind. The fastsdr function inside fastsdr.py file can find the SDR values much faster with very low error.

Error : to be calculated
Speed : also to be calculated
